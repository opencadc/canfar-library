# CANFAR Container Library

The CANFAR Container Library is a curated set of container images hosted by the [Canadian Astronomy Data Centre (CADC)](https://www.cadc-ccda.hia-iha.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/en/) for use with the [CANFAR Science Platform](https://www.opencadc.org/canfar/latest/) and the wider astronomy community. The library provides a convenient way to access, publish, and share container images for popular astronomy software.

The main focus of the library is to provide:

- Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)
- Exemplify best practices for containerization
- Actively rebuild for updates and security patches
- Promote community contribution and collaboration

In essence, the library aims to help astronomers and developers build, share, and deploy reproducible, secure, and scalable scientific applications.
